      - Commander, according to the plan, this is not the time for us to have a conversation.
    id_002:
      content:
      - I think you know better than I do about how urgent the situation is right
        now.
      - My defense was close to disintegrating, and I'd like to know when that rescue
        team
      - you were talking about would finally arrive.
      narrator: Me
    id_003:
      content:
      - As I'm sure you're aware, the help I'm talking about has been right there
        with you all along.
      - But if I don't have the stuff, I won't let them go.
    id_004:
      content:
      - Then I'd like to know why there was no mention of SangvisFerri in the documents
        which
      - were provided in the first place.
      narrator: Me
    id_005:
      content:
      - SangvisFerri should not know about this, if I may say so. But as things stood,
      - someone on the inside must have leaked the information.
    id_006:
      content:
      - If we don't get the support, I don't think my troops will be able to hold
        very long,
      - so how will we ever find what you're asking for?
      narrator: Me
    id_007:
      content:
      - That's okay. Since the girls under your command can only do so much to support
      - you, then just keep going. I'll figure out the rest.
    id_008:
      content:
      - End of communication.
    id_009:
      content:
      - Damn it, I should have never accepted this commission in the first place.

      - It's not your fault either...

      content:
      - Now, let's just hope that sv-98 and the others will be back in time, and we'll
        think about
      - other things after that.
      narrator: Me
    id_012:
      content:
      - And what if they don't make it back?

      - I have to admit, that I have thought about all kinds of situations that may
        occur
      - during the mission.
    id_001:
      content:
      - But I didn't expect, that our mission will go south so quickly.
    id_002:
      content:
      - Commander, SangvisFerri's attack is getting fiercer. If this continues, the
        remaining
      - troops will soon be surrounded and annihilated! It's time to proceed with
        the evacuation
      - procedure.
      narrator: Kalina
    id_003:
      content:
      - Any good news about them? The tenth logistic unit...
      narrator: Me
    id_004:
      content:
      - I haven't been able to get ahold of them, so i have no idea what's going on...
      - That's worrisome. If we keep this up, it is only a matter of time before SangvisFerri
      - surrounds the place.

      - The latest communication shows that they were on a site 50 kilometers away.
      - However, it fell under SangvisFerri's control 13 hours ago.
      narrator: Kalina
    id_006:
      content:
      - Can we send someone out to search the area?
      narrator: Me
    id_007:
      content:
      - All operational troops are currently spread out on the first line of defense.
      - Not to mention breaking through, it's already fortunate to be able to block
        SangvisFerri's
      - attack! If we pull out any force at this point, the defense will soon fall
        apart.
      narrator: Kalina
    id_008:
      content:
      - Damn it, where's that backup we were talking about? And this is just an island
        with no
      - resources whatsoever! Why the National Security Bureau is so concerned?
      narrator: Me
    id_009:
      content:
      - I don't really know. The commission only mentions that it's related to information
      - intercepted by the National Security Bureau. Other than that, no more information
        was
      - revealed.

      - Okay, I'm on it.
      narrator: Kalina
    id_014:
      content:
      - At the moment, I was very anxious, whether sv-98 and the others could make
        it back
      - before the evacuation is one thing. I have a feeling that there is something
        very secret
      - on this island that Griffin and even the National Security Bureau themselves
        don't even
      - know about yet.
    id_015:

      - The commander has already sent a helicopter to pick us up.
      - We just need to clear the area in case there's an accident when the helicopter
        lands.
    id_018:
      content:
      - Let's hurry up! As long as we can destroy all SangvisFerri's forces in the
        area before
      - the helicopters arrive, we'll be able to evacuate safely.
    id_019:
