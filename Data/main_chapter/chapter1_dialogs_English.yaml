      - Ding......
    1:
      content:
      - Commander, according to the plan, this is not our time to communicate.
    2:
      content:
      - I think you know better than I do what's really going on right now. My echelon
        has crumbled.
      - So I'd like to know when that rescue you were talking about will arrive.
      narrator: Me
    3:
      content:
      - As I'm sure you're aware, the help I'm talking about has been right there
        with you all along.
      - But if I don't have the stuff, I won't let them go.
    4:
      content:
      - Then I'd like to know why there was no mention of SangvisFerri in the documents
        which
      - were provided in the first place.
      narrator: Me
    5:
      content:
      - By all rights, SangvisFerri should not know about this. But as things stood,
      - someone on the inside must have leaked this information.
    6:
      content:
      - If we don't have support, our echelon will soon be unable to hold up, so how
        will we ever
      - find what you're asking for?
      narrator: Me
    7:
      content:
      - That's okay. Since the girls under your command can only do so much to support
      - you, then just keep going. I'll figure out the rest
    8:
      content:
      - End of communication.
    9:
      content:
      - Damn it, I should have never accepted this commission in the first place.
      narrator: Me
    10:
      content:
      - It's not your fault either...
      narrator: Kalina
    11:
      content:
      - Now, let's just hope that sv-98 and the others will be back in time, and we'll
        think about
      - other things after that!
      narrator: Me
    12:
      content:
      - And what if they don't make it back?
      narrator: Kalina
    13:
      content:
      - Then... There's no other way...
      narrator: Me
    14:

      - Thanks for trying out Girls' Frontline - Last Wish, more content is still
        in development,
      - so stay tuned!

      content:
      - In my subconscious, I used to worry about accidents.
    1:
      content:
      - But I didn't expect, that the accident will come such soon.
    2:
      content:
      - Commander, SangvisFerri's attack is getting fiercer. If this continues, the
        remaining
      - echelon will soon be routed! It's time to order a standard evacuation procedure.
      narrator: Kalina
    3:
      content:
      - Any good news about them? The tenth logistic unit...
      narrator: Me
    4:
      content:
      - I haven't been able to get ahold of them, so i have no idea what's going on...
      - That's worrisome. If we keep this up, it's only a matter of time before SangvisFerri
      - surrounds the place.

      - It's on a plain about 50 kilometers east of here.
      - It fell under SangvisFerri's control 13 hours ago.
      narrator: Kalina
    6:
      content:
      - Can we send someone out to search the area?
      narrator: Me
    7:
      content:
      - All operational echelons are currently spread out on the first line of defense.
        Not to mention
      - breaking through, it's already fortunate to be able to barely block SangvisFerri's
        attack! If we
      - pull out any more force at this point, the defense may soon be routed.
      narrator: Kalina
    8:
      content:
      - Damn it, where's that backup we were talking about? And this is just an island
        with no
      - resources whatsoever! Why the National Security Bureau is so concerned?
      narrator: Me
    9:
      content:
      - I don't really know. The commission only mentions that it's related to information
      - intercepted by the National Security Bureau. Other than that, no more information
        was
      - revealed.
      narrator: Kalina
    10:
      content:
      - Kalina...
      narrator: Me
    11:

      - Start the evacuation procedure. Then get me K. I need to talk to him.
      narrator: Me
    13:
      content:
      - Okay, I'm on it.
      narrator: Kalina
    14:
      content:
      - At the moment, I was very uneasy, whether sv-98 and the others could make
        it back before
      - the evacuation is one thing, but I have a feeling there's a mystery on this
        island that
      - Griffin and even the National Security Bureau themselves don't know about
        yet.
    15:
      content:
      - 24 hours ago.
    16:
      content:
      - Asval, how's everything going so far?
      narrator: Sv-98
    17:
      content:
      - The commander has already sent a helicopter to pick us up.
      - We just need to clear the area in case there's an accident when the helicopter
        lands.
    18:
      content:
      - Let's hurry up! As long as we take out as much of the current SangvisFerri
        forces
      - in the area before the helicopters arrive, then we'll be able to evacuate
        safely.
      narrator: Sv-98
    19:
      content:
      - Great!
      narrator: Other dolls
    20:
      content:
      - Keep your voice down! It's not like SangvisFerri didn't have ears.
      narrator: Sv-98
