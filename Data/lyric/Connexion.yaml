lyric:
  00:34.38: The layer of dust, is telling the story
  00:42.25: Together with pride, lying on the cold ground
  00:50.27: Remembered the day you sighed when the last leaf
  00:58.35: of the dying tree, falling on the new green
  01:05.63: If I divine your meaning, would you stay here
  01:13.65: Instead of leaving and breaking this connection
  01:25.88: Do you see, how things change, you used to be my flame
  01:33.92: Just too faint to stay, in the darkness and rain
  01:41.83: You flee from me, to somewhere I cannot reach
  01:49.63: And made a wall, a hedge between
  02:00.18: I pray every night for that tree to blossom
  02:08.13: And day after day, keep breathing the silence
  02:16.11: You know loneliness, has almost devoured me
  02:24.29: I’m longing for a thud, wake me up in a sudden
  02:31.72: If I can make it happen, would you come back?
  02:39.63: And give me the chance to fix this connection?
  02:51.74: Do you see how we change
  02:55.93: There is no need to blame
  02:59.95: Who can set my heart free?
  03:03.90: Everything has its trail
  03:07.69: But deep inside, I’m still waiting for you
  03:15.60: To be the light, lead me to realize......
  03:40.87: I tell myself a lie, no way to win the fight
  03:44.93: I even never try, just set the fear high
  03:48.95: Holding my pride tide, until your tears dry
  03:52.88: Without you in my life, my sky is never bright
  03:55.98: Do you see how things changed, you used to be my flame?
  04:04.01: Just too faint to stay, in the darkness and rain
  04:11.84: You flee from me to somewhere I can not reach
  04:19.55: And made a wall, a hedge between
  04:27.81: Do you see...
  04:34.48: To be my flame...
  04:42.62: Darkness and rain...
  04:50.45: I cannot reach
