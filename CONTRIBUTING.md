- It would be best if you can fork the "dev" branch as your starting point. If the "dev" branch does not exist, then fork the "master" branch.

  你应该fork "dev"分支作为作为你的起始点。如果"dev"分支不存在，则fork "master"分支。

- After you have finished your work, you should request to merge to the "dev" branch. If the "dev" branch does not exist, you can request to merge to the "master" branch.

  所有合并请求应该请求合并到"dev"分支中。如果"dev"不存在，则请求合并到"master"分支。

- We are looking forward to seeing a pull request that contains a detailed explanation about any changes that were made.

  所有合并请求应该阐明所有关于改动的细节。
